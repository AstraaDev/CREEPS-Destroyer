# CREEPS-Destroy
Creeps is a game where you will have to complete a set of specific actions to obtain achievements.
Validation of this activity is based on achievements, not on traces. Instead of passing tests, you first
have to complete a set of basic achievements to validate the rush and get access to more advanced
achievements.
To play the game you will have to interact with a server and implement strategies in order to survive
and attain your goals.
