## üìñ Project Overview

**CREEPS Destroyer** is a project developed as part of the APP ING1 course at EPITA, and to showcase the full potential of the Creeps game. The objective is to push the game's mechanics to their limits, automating and optimizing every aspect to create the most efficient and complete strategy possible.

While the game technically has no definitive end, this project aims to develop a system capable of progressing as far as possible, optimizing resource management, base expansion, and survival against threats.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

### Start a Local Server  

If you want to test the project locally, you need to start a Creeps server:  

```sh
java -jar creeps-server.jar
```

This will start a local server on the default port `1664`.  

### Run CREEPS Destroyer  

To launch the project and connect to a server (local or online), use the following command:  

```sh
java -jar target/creeps-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <SERVER_HOST> <PORT> <USERNAME>
```

Replace:  
- `<SERVER_HOST>` with the server address (e.g., `localhost` for local testing).  
- `<PORT>` with the server port (default: `1664`).  
- `<USERNAME>` with your in-game login.
